# prime-calculator
A group of individual programs that compute on Prime Numbers

Programs:
  1) Prime Factoriser
  2) Divisible Numbers Finder
  3) Co-prime Checker
  4) Twin Prime Generator

**Note:** Due to my limited time on developing this project, The _Twin Prime Generator_ & _Divisible Numbers Finder_ will lag your entire system when interupted (by clicking anywhere on the screen)
